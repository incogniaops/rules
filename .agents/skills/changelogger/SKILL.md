# CHANGELOG.md maintenance

## When to use

When adding or updating entries in CHANGELOG.md for any project following rules conventions.
Language policy for entries:

- Personal context: Mexican Spanish.
- Corporate context: International English (UK).

## Instructions

1. **Read the full CoT**: Load and follow `~/rules/cot/changelog.md` from line 1 to end
2. **Step 0 + hard stop (MANDATORY)**: run `git --no-pager status --short` to validate all current changes before any other operation.
   If this exact status check has not been executed in the current run, HARD STOP immediately, restart from this step, and do absolutely nothing else (no read, `grep`, search, date calculation, anchor calculation, diff, or patch).
3. **Step 1 (MANDATORY)**: read `CHANGELOG.md` lines `1-200` before any `grep`, search loop, or patch attempt.
   If this exact read has not been executed in the current run, HARD STOP immediately, restart from step 2, and do absolutely nothing else.
4. **Get CST date**: `DATE_CST=$(TZ=America/Mexico_City date +"%Y-%m-%d")` — NEVER use UTC with "CST" suffix
5. **Check existing entries**: Verify if `## [YYYY-MM-DD]` already exists to avoid duplicate headings
6. **Update the target date block** (reverse chronological order):
   - **If the date already exists**: add new typed bullets inside that existing block; do NOT create a duplicate heading.
   - **First-attempt rule (MANDATORY)**: for an existing date block, the first attempt MUST use one single-hunk micro-block replacement with exact `search` = `## [YYYY-MM-DD] - ...` + immediate blank line + first existing bullet.
   - **Insertion rule (MANDATORY)**: in that same hunk, reproduce the heading and blank line intact, then insert the new bullet above the previous first bullet.
   - **No intra-block blank line (MANDATORY)**: keep bullets contiguous inside the same date block; never add an empty line between bullets of that block.
   - **If the date does not exist**: create `## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Short descriptive title` at the top and add typed bullets.
   - **Spacing rule (MANDATORY)**: keep exactly one blank line between the last bullet of the target date block and the next `## [YYYY-MM-DD]` heading.
   - **Fallback rule (MANDATORY, new date only)**: if insertion preview still shows no blank separator line after creating a new date block, switch immediately to a two-hunk edit (first hunk inserts the new block, second hunk enforces `blank line + next heading`).
   - Base format:

     ```markdown
     ## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Short descriptive title

     - type/tipo: context-appropriate change description
     ```

7. **Language**: Personal entries in Mexican Spanish; corporate entries in International English (UK); no emojis.
8. **Type in bullets**: Use context-appropriate prefix:
   - Personal: `tipo:`
   - Corporate: `type:`
   Prefix must match valid commit types (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`, `test`, `build`).
9. **Verify**: Check that the new entry is above all previous entries

## Critical rules

- Date format: `[YYYY-MM-DD]` only — no time component
- CST = UTC - 6 hours (verify with `TZ=America/Mexico_City date`)
- No emojis in CHANGELOG entries
- Descriptive title after the date: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] - Short descriptive title`
- Do NOT use subheadings like `### feat`/`### fix` inside a date entry
- Keep exactly one blank line between consecutive date blocks (`## [YYYY-MM-DD]`)
- Keep bullets contiguous within the same date block (no blank lines between bullets)
- Incremental mode is insert-only by default: only `+` additions are allowed; deleting existing `CHANGELOG.md` lines requires explicit user instruction
- Step 0 is mandatory: run `git --no-pager status --short` first to validate all current changes in the run
- HARD STOP absolute: if step 0 (`git --no-pager status --short`) or the precise read of `CHANGELOG.md` lines `1-200` is missing in the current run, stop and restart from instruction 2; no other action is allowed
- NEVER edit entries from dates different than `DATE_CST` (current day) unless explicitly instructed by the user

## Anti-error and anti-pattern protocol (MANDATORY)

1. Run `git --no-pager status --short` as the first operation of the run to validate all current changes.
2. HARD STOP gate: if there is no explicit evidence that step 1 happened in the current run, stop immediately and restart from step 1; absolutely no further action is allowed.
3. Read `CHANGELOG.md` lines `1-200` as the second operation of the run (before `grep`, extra search, or patch attempts).
4. HARD STOP gate: if there is no explicit evidence that step 3 happened in the current run, stop immediately and restart from step 1; absolutely no further action is allowed.
5. Verify CST date and existing heading before editing (`TZ=America/Mexico_City date` + `grep -n "^## \\[${DATE_CST}\\]" CHANGELOG.md`).
6. Read the exact target date block before inserting bullets.
7. If `DATE_CST` heading exists, first attempt MUST be one single-hunk micro-block replacement (`heading + blank line + first bullet`) and insertion of the new bullet at top of the block (no blank line between bullets).
8. Validate immediately with `git --no-pager diff -- CHANGELOG.md`.
9. Acceptance criterion: insertion-only diff inside the target date block (only `+` lines); any deleted line (`-`) invalidates the attempt unless the user explicitly requested deletion.
10. If validation fails: do one minimal correction after re-reading the exact block.
11. If creating a new date block and blank separator line is missing, apply mandatory two-hunk fallback:
    - Hunk 1: insert the new date block above the next date heading.
    - Hunk 2: anchor on the next heading and replace with `blank line + same heading` to force spacing.
12. If validation shows changes outside the target date block: stop and ask user confirmation; do NOT auto-correct historical entries.
13. If it fails again: stop and ask user confirmation before any further attempt.
14. Never chain 3+ consecutive attempts on CHANGELOG without an intermediate successful diff validation.
15. For existing-date insertion, NEVER anchor the edit from the top heading (for example `# Changelog`) or any file-top replacement; anchor only on `heading + blank line + first bullet`.
16. If an insertion-only attempt shows any deleted line (`-`) anywhere in `CHANGELOG.md`, abort that patch and rebuild the anchor before retrying; deletions are allowed only with explicit user instruction.

Forbidden anti-patterns:

- Continuing the run without explicit evidence that `git --no-pager status --short` was executed in the current execution.
- Continuing the run without explicit evidence that `CHANGELOG.md` lines `1-200` were read after step 0 in the current execution.
- Attempting to recover mid-run after skipping step 0 or step 1 instead of hard-stopping and restarting from step 0.
- Starting with `grep`, search loops, or patch attempts before reading `CHANGELOG.md` lines `1-200` after executing step 0.
- Reapplying the same failed anchor without adjusting to the real block content.
- Using partial anchors for existing-date insertion (e.g., only the heading line).
- Using `search = heading + first bullet` without the required blank line between them for existing-date insertion.
- Rewriting full `CHANGELOG.md` to insert a single bullet.
- Editing with ad-hoc scripts when a minimal anchored edit is sufficient.
- Adding an empty line between bullets inside the same date block.
- Omitting the required blank line between consecutive date blocks.
- Repeating the same failed `+6` insertion attempt without switching to two-hunk fallback.
- Repeating discovery/search loops after the target date block is already identified.
- Editing entries outside the current day block (`DATE_CST`) without explicit user instruction.
- Continuing to commit flow when CHANGELOG diff acceptance criterion is not met.
- Anchoring an existing-date insertion from the top heading (for example `# Changelog`) or replacing the file-top section instead of the micro-block anchor.
- Accepting a patch that deletes separator blank lines when the goal is only to prepend bullets in the current-day block.
- Deleting any existing `CHANGELOG.md` line during incremental insertion without explicit user instruction.
